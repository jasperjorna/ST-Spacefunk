# Spacefunk

Spacefunk is a minimalistic theme for Sublime Text, based on [kkga's](https://github.com/kkga/spacegray) Spacegray theme.

## Install

### Via Package Control

Search for `Theme - Spacefunk` in [Sublime Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net).

### Manual

1. [Download the .zip](https://github.com/Twiebie/ST-Spacefunk/archive/master.zip)
2. Unzip and rename the folder to `Theme - Spacefunk`
3. Copy the folder to your `Packages` directory. Quickly find your directory via 
`Preferences -> Browse Packages...`.

## Setup

You can activate the theme and its colour scheme by editing your user preferences.
Go to: `Preferences -> Settings - User`.

### Example settings

### Additional customization
If you prefer a lighter version of the sidebar you can add the following line to your preferences file. This is available for both versions of Spacefunk.

```
{
  "spacefunk_sidebar_light": true

```
Restart Sublime Text to make sure all changes are applied. Enjoy!

#### Future Funk - Colour schemes
I've created 2 colour schemes that fit well with the theme.
They are maintained separately from Spacefunk.

Find them on: [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Future%20Funk%20-%20Color%20Scheme) or [Github](https://github.com/Twiebie/ST-FutureFunk).
